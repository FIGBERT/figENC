# figENC
RSA and symmetric key encryption scripts and executables by FIGBERT

figENC provides incredibly strong, industry standard RSA encryption to any kind and/or size of file on your computer, and spits the encryption keys back out to you to store in a secure location – like an encrypted flashdrive, Keybase storage, or even encrypted with figENC again with a new set of keys.
