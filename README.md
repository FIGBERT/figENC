# figENC
RSA and symmetric key encryption scripts and executables by FIGBERT, programmed in Python with a tkinter GUI.

figENC provides incredibly strong, industry standard RSA encryption to any kind and/or size of file on your computer, and spits the encryption keys back out to you to store in a secure location – like an encrypted flashdrive, Keybase storage, or even encrypted with figENC again using a new set of keys.

How To:

* MacOS
  * Navigate to the Executables directory and download the DMG. On opening the DMG, drag the app into the applications directory and voila!
* Windows
  * Navigate to the Executables directory and download the ZIP. Open the ZIP file, and move the resulting directory to your program files directory. Open the EXE within the directory and voila! Pin it to taskbar or desktop for an optimal user experience.
* Linux
  * Download the Scripts directory, and rename it figENC. Navigate inside, run `python3 figENC.py`, and voila!
  * A terminal package for figENC is in the pipline for Linux users – more details on that will be released when it nears production, so keep an eye out for that!
